Alright, I’ll **first give you the filled answers (clean, exam-ready)** and **then list exactly which CS topics these questions come from**. No fluff.

## ✅ **Fill in the blanks — Answers**

1️⃣ **The sorting algorithm that requires the least number of swaps is**
👉 **Selection Sort**

---

2️⃣ **A topological ordering exists if and only if the graph is**
👉 **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**

---

3️⃣ **The data structure used in Dijkstra’s algorithm is**
👉 **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**
(*or simply “Heap” in exams*)

---

4️⃣ **A minimum spanning tree is unique if and only if**
👉 **All edge weights are distinct**

---

5️⃣ **In hashing with open addressing, ___ probing technique suffers from primary clustering**
👉 **Linear Probing**

---

6️⃣ **The maximum number of nodes at level (i) of a binary tree is**
👉 **(2^i)**

---

7️⃣ **In a Binary Search Tree, the worst-case time complexity of deleting a node is**
👉 **(O(n))**

---

8️⃣ **The number of structurally distinct binary trees with (n) nodes is**
👉 **Catalan Number**
[
C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}
]

---

9️⃣ **In a B-tree of order 5, the minimum number of keys in a non-root node is**
👉 **2**

📌 Reason:

* Order (m = 5)
* Minimum children = (\lceil m/2 \rceil = 3)
* Minimum keys = children − 1 = **2**

---

🔟 **In a B-tree of order 7, if a non-root node has 2 keys, then it must have ___ children**
👉 **3 children**

📌 Rule:
[
\text{children} = \text{keys} + 1
]

If you want, I can:

* turn this into a **1-page exam cheat sheet**
* give **memory tricks**
* or give **MCQ traps profs use** 😈
